One of the worst ways to leave a meeting is confused. What am I supposed to be doing? What was that one person talking about? What is the next step here? It's a waste of everyone's time. Meetings are a necessary evil, but they are pure evil when they don't have clear outcomes.

There are two ways this happens.

1. You created the meeting and you just kinda jumped in to what you wanted to talk about without giving everyone time to wrap their head around the subject matter. You didn't do intros, set context, or check in and let people ask questions. If you ask people if they have questions at the end and people just kinda silently look at you, the meeting is probably a failure. [Silence is dissent](https://twitter.com/clairevo/status/1580223055158120449?s=20&t=iRd56unEKvavCdBpdeWv_g).
2. You attended a meeting, and you didn't ask questions, either because you were afraid to look stupid, or you didn't understand enough to even ask the questions. There's a lot of responsibility on the meeting runner to make sure the meeting makes sense, but you as an attendee also have a responsibility to get clarity.

So, how can you solve for this? I've done this the wrong way more times than I can count, so one of the ways to get good is to just brute-force it until you learn through pain to get better. But there are shortcuts that will help!

As a meeting organizer:

1. Set context: What are we here to talk about? What's the goal? Why? Setting up the problem you are looking to solve in the meeting is by far the most important thing. Usually everything else flows from this. DO NOT skimp here. Err on the side of over-explaining the problem/context.
2. Check in regularly: You should only talk for maybe a few minutes before pausing to get the temperature. Is everyone getting it? Look out for those 'deer in headlights' eyes. Call on people in particular if they seem lost. Be nice, but direct.
3. Review what was discussed and what the action items are at least 4 minutes before the end of the meeting. What outcomes did we get to? Does everyone agree on your interpretation?
4. Summarize the meeting and send notes to everyone at the end. Send it in slack, create meeting notes on the calendar entry. What was discussed, what are the action items, and when can we expect an update?
5. Set a reminder for yourself or the meeting attendees to follow-up when everyone expects right at the end or even during the meeting. Do not wait. Do it in your calendar or slack.

As a meeting attendee:

1. Ask questions if you are confused. Either wait for them to check-in, or if they don't, interrupt them. Do not let the organizer keep going if you are confused. You are very likely not the only one, and even if you are who cares. Presumably you are in the meeting because you are important, it is essential you don't leave confused. I can't emphasize this enough.
2. Take notes: If the meeting organizer doesn't summarize the meeting, you will forget the details of the meeting in about 48 hours. Take notes, and if the organizer doesn't send a summary, you should and you should check-in to make sure they align with the organizer's expectations.

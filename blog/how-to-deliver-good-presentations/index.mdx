This is actually pretty simple to do well, but you really have to put in the practice time. Don't kid yourself, it is humiliating to fuck up a presentation because you didn't practice enough. Unforced Error. Here's how to do it.

1. Do an ‘off the cuff’ version with no slides, or minimal slides.
2. Experience the visceral terror of how bad the presentation will be if you do it ‘off the cuff’ or unpracticed.
3. Do it a couple more times to really fire up the ‘presentation’ neurons
4. Write down what you want to say like it was a speech, literally word for word what you want to say to the audience. 
5. Practice the written down version a couple times
6. Edit it heavily
7. Practice 5-10 more times, making little adjustments, until you can mostly do it without looking at your text

Voila. Your presentation will most likely not suck, and you will have a confident handle on the material so that you can dynamically deliver it in front of an audience with a relative sense of comfort.

So you’ve joined a new team, company, etc and you are experiencing the cold terror that is your new responsibility area as a product manager. 

I think you have about 90 days to demonstrate that you are going to be a net positive addition to the team and to build up trust. What do you do?

This assumes:
- The product already exists
- There are existing users

My opinion on this is you need to:
- Get ahold of as many customers as possible within the next 30 days and have them walk you through their product usage and your product feature in particular. Have them share their screen while they do this. Write out your questions loosely beforehand, and adjust rapidly with the first few customers until you get a feel for which questions elicit the best answers. Record everything, and then tag key statements around pain points, etc, with a tool like Dovetail. 
- Insist on involving the engineering manager and designer associated with your product area in the customer discussions. This has multiple benefits, including demonstrating your ability to understand customer pain points and developing shared context between your key stakeholders.
- Learn where all the bodies are buried in the data. Do not rely on the data team, you need to get familiar with querying raw data. Know the key tables and how to produce good output. 
- Manage your stress. Exercise, take supplements, and sleep enough that you don’t freak out. If you are doing this right, the first 90-days should feel like watching ‘Uncut Gems’ nonstop. Act accordingly. 
- Ignore everything that is not the above. No one will really care that you followed whatever process/ritual properly if your product area doesn’t deliver. Let people chase you down and yell at you for things that aren’t really consequential. You need to hold your responsibility to your product area above all else. That doesn’t mean you need to be unnecessarily rude or obnoxious, but it’s ok to drop balls that don’t matter. 

## Talking to Customers

I want to call attention to the last point first, because I think it’s really tempting to do ‘busy work’ when you don’t know what you’re doing. Little work rituals like grooming your backlog, getting to know colleagues, having pointless meetings to ‘get aligned’, can feel really compelling early on. But when quarterly business reports are due, that’s where the rubber hits the road. No one remembers that you did your tickets right if your numbers suck or you don’t have anything in the pipeline worth talking about. Your colleagues will remember you as a ‘nice person’ they would never recommend for future roles as you get walked out the door. 

There is something about talking to a ton of customers, and living in the data, that makes most decisions reveal themselves as obvious. You need to have the confidence to ignore everything but this, I promise your manager will experience a level of euphoria most can only dream of when you come across as extremely competent in front of leadership. They will forgive whatever other transgressions. 

How do you talk to a bunch of customers? Email them! Write out your top 1-2 questions in your (very) short email, then invite the customer to chat more with a Calendly link. I generally get more interaction over email, which is fine! The conversations are great too, but allow people the ability to write out their thoughts. Reply super quickly, if you can reply within 5-10 minutes of receiving an email the customer is much more likely to get back to you and have a substantial conversation. People replying quickly is exciting, embrace that. 

## Involving the Team

You then want to make sure your engineering manager and design leader are on as many calls as possible. You probably can’t require it as you are going for sheer throughput in the beginning and aligning schedules will slow things down too much. That said, push hard for this. 

In my opinion, the true value of a PM is being able to build a shared mind between engineering, design, and customers. Product takes on a lot of the grunt work involved in developing customer evidence, arguing about what a good experience is based on that evidence and their intuition, and articulating the direction via strategy docs, PRDs, etc. However, if you don’t deeply involve engineering and design with customer conversations, not to mention PRD and strategy doc development, they won’t feel like real teammates, and the reality of product development is that you are a team. You will be kneecapping yourself, and most likely your product will suffer for it, as design and eng will have to make assumptions where they don’t have those customer conversations in mind. 

## Live in the data

Your data team is your friend, but do not rely on the data team. You need to be able to query raw tables to understand user behavior, and you’ll need the data team to help you do that. But do not create tickets for the data team to solve unless there is missing data or things that are multiple levels beyond your skill set. You need to become a weak data analyst for your product area. 

Why do this if it’s someone else’s job to specialize in it? Because of your customer conversations, you will have stronger opinions and an ability to iterate on your data analysis more quickly than a dedicated team will be able to. I also find that in the process of querying the data, my own intuition improves much more rapidly because the feedback loop is much faster. In general, any time you can shorten a feedback loop you should. 

## Manage your stress

I write about this more [here](https://www.jimmyhooker.com/blog/strategies-for-dealing-with-anxiety-and-stress/), but managing your stress is important. You are effectively red-lining your system. You can freak out if you don’t learn effective coping strategies. 

Easy and obvious ones are exercise and sleep. I personally find that hard exercise (but not necessarily long), where I can’t think for some period of time, is the best. There are also numerous supplements that help with maintaining a sense of calm focus. Do what works for you, but make sure it works. 

Stress generally only has lasting impact if it’s chronic. Ideally you can orient around a single quarter that is really aggressive, and then shift to execution which generally isn’t as emotionally taxing. It should be harder to figure out the plan than to execute it if you’re doing it right. 

## Ignore everything that doesn’t matter

Work is full of ritual and circumstance that can be very distracting. Humans are social creatures. We want to show that we are part of the team, that we belong, that we are easy to work with. You can’t ignore these entirely, but if you are working at a high-pressure startup where you have to show results quickly, you must realize that none of the tribal stuff will matter if you show up empty handed in a few months time. 

That means you need to ignore anything that doesn’t affect your core focus, which is delivering an aligned roadmap. Allow yourself to be bad or sloppy at everything else.

One failure mode I’ve seen is people who get overwhelmed by a responsibility area and instead of dealing with the core issues, instead focus on reporting and narratives. Narratives are important, but it’s much easier to explain problems than it is to solve them. Do not fall into this trap. Eventually people tire of the stories. 

It is my strong belief that if you follow these precepts, you will either succeed at a very high level or find out your job is not actually possible. You may find that you are constrained by resources, company priorities, etc in a way that is not solvable from your position. That can be scary! However, in my experience, if you bring the challenges your product area faces to leadership and articulate where you need executive help, you will either get it or get the respect that you need to be put on something that is more important and solvable. 

Best of luck!

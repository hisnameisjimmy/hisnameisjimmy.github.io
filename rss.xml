However, I’ve always simultaneously pushed myself really, really hard. Which meant I had to develop coping strategies to survive. Here’s what worked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Supplements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zembrin: Basically calm, energized focus in a pill. No side effects that I’ve seen. Remarkable supplement. If you have trouble with focus and energy, try this first. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;L-Theanine: Gits rid of the jitters from caffeine. Naturally occurring in Green Tea, if you are sensitive to the effects of caffeine it basically gives you all the good without the bad. Completely changed coffee for me. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lavender Pills: Noticeably calmer but not so much that it feels like a hindrance or produces side-effects. Pleasantly calm. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magnesium Citrate: Useful to go to sleep, just be careful to not take too much. It is a diarrhetic and will give you wild gas if you over do it. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beta Blockers: Great if you experience situational anxiety so intense that there’s no real “takeaways” or learning from the experience. Very useful for things like interviews where it’s harder to get “at bats” and the stakes are high. The key feature is it makes it so your anxiety/fear doesn’t produce physical side-effects, like shakey or sweaty hands, rapid heart rate, twitching, etc. It’s non-addictive and isn’t mind altering, but beware that it keeps heart rate down so you can’t exercise on it (your heart rate won’t keep up with the exercise). The cool thing is you still experience the fear, but it is more thrilling because of the lake of physical stuff. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise / Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intense Exercise: I ride my bike up hills so steep they cause me to lose feeling in my fingers, and I feel incredible, almost euphoric afterward. I have related this to others, and almost everyone who does some form of exercise that is so intense they can’t think during parts of it remarks the same thing. You just feel great afterward. Doesn’t need to take a long time, 20 minutes of exercise that includes 5 minutes of super high intensity is great. I like biking because I get to see cool stuff while I’m doing it, and see way more than other exercise, but do whatever you like. If you like it, you’ll do it more often. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minimum strength training: I can do about 50 push-ups in a single set along with 50 squats at the age of 40. I never do more than 1 set of these in a day. I know very few people who can do this at any age, much less 40. The trick is that you never push yourself too hard. Make it easy, and keep it easy. It takes very little of my time and it makes my body feel great. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get an amount of sleep that makes you feel good. This really varies from person to person. I usually only let myself get 7 hours minimum, but I probably could use 9. My wife gets 9 and feels great. I wish I could discipline myself to do this, I think it’s probably the next big unlock for me. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Meditation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ana Pana aka breath meditation/focus: This is what you do for the first 3 days of a 10-day sit when doing a Goenka-style Vipassana. Just focus on the breath leaving/entering your nose. Pay attention to everything about it, go ‘deep’ on your attention, notice the humidity, the sensation, how one nostril is closed, the quality of the breath. See how long you can focus before your mind wanders. 1 minute is a big achievement here. Quick, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyM_c3wSh8s&quot;&gt;Goenka-led 15-minute version&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vipassana aka “body scanning”: Start at the top of your head, and slowly move down your body, focusing on the sensation on your skin. If you are doing this right (ie with the right level of focus), you can usually feel your body releasing tension while you’re doing it. This can be hard to do well without getting good at Ana Pana first. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Little Cheats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/health/box-breathing#slowly-exhale&quot;&gt;Box Breathing&lt;/a&gt;: 4 seconds breathe in, 4 seconds hold, 4 seconds breathe out, 4 seconds hold. Repeat. Has a noticeable calming effect. Do this for a couple minutes and you can quickly center. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cold Showers: Aka &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wimhofmethod.com/benefits-of-cold-showers&quot;&gt;Wim Hoff showers&lt;/a&gt;. The cheat here is to take a hot shower, and then at the end switch to cold. It’s a great systemic wake up, see how long you can do it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Psychology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talking to yourself/coaching yourself: You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/devonzuegel/status/1770480691416834299?s=20&quot;&gt;talk to yourself in a friendly way&lt;/a&gt;, as if you are coaching a friend. E.g. “Let’s not think about that right now, we can think about it later. It’s time to go to sleep, let’s go to sleep”. “It’s time to focus, we need to focus on this and get it done. Let’s focus on this task really hard”. “Tonight when we sleep let’s really clear the brain, we don’t need to repair physically as much.” It is kind of insane how well this works. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reframing: The kids probably call this ‘cope’ now, but reframing is a key psychological device. Cope is useful to survive! If you have a shitty experience, there can be a tendency to just focus on the negative, but that’s actually an inaccurate way to view experience. Almost all experience has upside. Focus on it! What was good about it? Articulate it, write it down, feel the goodness of it. A lot of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is oriented around this. It’s basically positive self-talk within a framework. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Becoming your own friend: I’m gonna work on a whole post on this, but learning to like yourself is the ultimate unlock and basically solves for most everything else. Just like you root for your friends, love your friends, and give them good advice, you gotta root for yourself, love yourself, and give yourself good advice. This is a consistent practice, and if your default is to be mean to yourself, either emotionally or verbally, it takes practice. I’m no where near done yet, but just the little bit I’ve done has dramatically helped. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stop trying to be other people: You are yourself, that’s really all you can be. Learn to be the best version of that shamelessly. Trust your judgement of what this means. You will never be able to compete against people who are enjoying the experience of being themselves and doing what they’re doing. They will crush you. Just like you will crush others when you learn to do what you like and yourself. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appendix:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/visakanv/status/1326456124422324225?s=20&quot;&gt;https://x.com/visakanv/status/1326456124422324225?s=20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/devonzuegel/status/1770480691416834299?s=20&quot;&gt;https://x.com/devonzuegel/status/1770480691416834299?s=20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/corymuscara/status/1597242735865503756?s=20&quot;&gt;https://x.com/corymuscara/status/1597242735865503756?s=20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Debugging Tartine Bread]]></title><description><![CDATA[Recipe for the uninitiated:  Tartine Country Loaf .

The &lt;a href=&quot;https://a.co/d/1o5HBrA&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; is more detailed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to live 2 blocks from Tartine in the Mission of SF. A year ago we moved to the East Bay to seek a more, let&amp;#x27;s say, conducive atmosphere for our daughter to grow up in. But I missed having easy access to good bread! That is what got me started down this dark path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I gotta say, this journey has been rough. Many times I would think I&amp;#x27;d figured it out, only to then have a bad loaf and not understand what I did wrong. Things just seemed highly unpredictable. I watched tons of YouTube, read this forum, read the Sourdough Journey, the Bread Code, the Tartine book, Flour Water Salt Yeast, you get it. There was a lot of frustration, but I am an obsessive person by nature and I couldn&amp;#x27;t stop trying to figure it out. At one point I was baking 3 batches a week to speed up my understanding of what was/wasn&amp;#x27;t working. I&amp;#x27;ve easily baked &amp;gt; 100 batches in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of advice was really hard to parse. I texted with an award-winning baker in Berkeley and tried to get help on internet forums (including this one), but it was really hard to figure out which variables were off or which piece of advice was right. Was it my starter? Was it my bulk fermentation time? Was the levain just not active enough when I started the dough? Was I just too rough with shaping? Changing one thing seemed to have an effect, but then it would stop for some reason, and I wasn&amp;#x27;t sure whether to keep the change, revert the change, or change it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve finally been able to consistently produce that bottom loaf. No bad loaves anymore. And these two things nailed it for me:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using way more than the recommended amount of starter in the levain. Like, 30-45 grams of starter. I think this is the true key that unlocked way better loaves. If you remember anything from this, it&amp;#x27;s to just use more starter in your levain!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Starting with 98-100 degree water for bulk fermentation (our house is about 70 degrees). Because the levain was at ~70 degrees, it would bring water temp down a ton when mixed in. Then, fermantalyse inside the mixing bowl would bring the temp down even more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just those two things have made it so I get a consistent loaf in 3.5 to 4.5 hours of bulk fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things that didn&amp;#x27;t work:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Letting bulk fermentation go on much longer, like 6-8 hours (since I was getting underfermented loaves). For some reason this just produced weird loaves that would exhibit characteristics of under fermentation (caverns), but would also be impossible to work with like an over fermented loaf (ie the gluten had broken down and they were weirdly sticky and wet)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeding my starter every 12 hours (or more). This just sucked, was a huge hassle, felt wasteful, and didn&amp;#x27;t meaningfully matter in my experience. Goal was to get it super active, and I guess that worked, but it was so much overhead. Super annoying.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doing it by hand instead of using a KitchenAid mixer. I got some advice that maybe this was breaking down the gluten formation too much after fermantalyse. Didn&amp;#x27;t seem to matter, that said I got in the habit of doing it by hand after fermantalyse because of that debugging journey.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being super gentle with the dough, especially toward the end of bulk fermentation and shaping. I actually can&amp;#x27;t say this did nothing, but the loaves were so inconsistent that this was like the equivalent of buying $300 running shoes when you just took up the hobby. It&amp;#x27;s not what&amp;#x27;s going to really move the needle at that level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, I think some of the variability I was getting was due to a combination of starter activeness and the amount of starter I was mixing into the leavin. I just had no idea those were the key things. I also, especially in the beginning, just used a &amp;#x27;tablespoon&amp;#x27;, as described in the book. But, I wasn&amp;#x27;t careful about measuring that out and I assume would get &amp;#x27;lucky&amp;#x27; occasionally when putting in more starter and get a better loaf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I pretty much stick to the recipe as described. Here is what I do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starter Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;House is ~70 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;50g water, 50g 1:1 bread flour/wheat flour combo every 24 hours, always feed in the morning. Dump everything but 2 or so tablespoons of starter, maybe 30g.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making Levain&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mix 30-45g of starter (depending on how active it seems to be) with 200g 1:1 bread flour/wheat mixture and 200g of 78-80 degree water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wait 12 hours&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making dough&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turn the oven light on (this brings the oven temp up to around 83-84 degrees, which is a nice temp to bulk ferment at).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mix levain and flour/water in KitchenAid stand mixer. Use 98-102 degree water. Mix for a couple minutes on setting 2.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wait 30 minutes for fermantalyse to happen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mix in 20g of Salt with 50g of 90-100 degree water (this seems to matter less, I&amp;#x27;ve used 82 degree water and it was fine, but you&amp;#x27;re just looking to maintain temp). I now use my hands, but I&amp;#x27;m pretty confident you could use a stand mixer with a dough hook with no ill results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At this point the dough is often around 82 degrees, maybe 84. In my experience it will keep dropping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put the dough in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FXW61K1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Cambro container&lt;/a&gt;, then put it in the warm oven to maintain temp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do the stretch &amp;amp; folds like normal every 30 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After 3.5 to 4.5 hours, it should be doming. On the Cambro, sometimes the dough will show as being at or above the 2 liter line, but not always. As long as it&amp;#x27;s doming, it seems good in my experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shape into rounds, wait 30 min&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shape into loaves and drop into bannetons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overnight Retard&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I throw a tea towel over top the bannetons and toss in the fridge for what usually ends up being ~17 hours (I start the dough process in the morning and end by around 3pm). I&amp;#x27;ve also used saran wrap to not develop a &amp;#x27;skin&amp;#x27;, but the effects of this don&amp;#x27;t seem meaningful to me. I often bake one loaf, then wait another 2 days to bake the other one. It&amp;#x27;s still great! The fridge seems to do more than slow it down, it seems to basically stop fermentation in my experience. Maybe my fridge is on the colder side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baking:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place a cookie sheet in the bottom rack to prevent the bottom of the dutch oven from getting too hot and burning the loaf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set oven to 500 and wait for it to get to temp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pull out the dutch oven, rice flour the bottom and toss in the loaf direct from the fridge. The coldness of the loaf makes no difference in my experience to letting it sit out while the oven pre-heats. It&amp;#x27;s also easier to cut with a razer when it&amp;#x27;s cold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Score the loaf at a 45 degree angle to get that nice lip&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bring oven temp to 470 and bake for 20 minutes lid on&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take lid off dutch oven and bake for another 30 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps someone who was as frustrated as I was, and helps them get a bit less lost. Just use more starter in your levain!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Being Grateful]]></title><description><![CDATA[I think I've been trying to figure out myself and my relationship to the world since I was about 17.

About 20 years of introspection. That&amp;#x27;s... maybe too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I think some people are more or less addicted to &amp;quot;therapy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;healing&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;developing real goals, even very simple goals, probably helps people move on better than many systematized approaches bc those systems (therapy) are more interested in perpetuating themselves &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/CYMOsFuE9e&quot;&gt;https://t.co/CYMOsFuE9e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Simon Sarris (@simonsarris) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1508550534269186055?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 28, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charSet=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got into spiritual stuff when I was pretty young because I was deeply anxious and it impeded a lot of what I wanted to do and how I interacted with people. Some of this had to do with my parents, but some was probably built in. I thought if I figured myself out, I could finally live as my true self without anxiety. But it never really worked out, despite throwing a lot of weaponry at it, including therapy, intensive meditation, supplements, exercise, and more. Those things helped, but it usually felt like I was dealing with symptoms rather than the core of the thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier&quot;&gt;number of studies&lt;/a&gt; that extol the virtues of gratitude. Start a gratitude journal! It will make you notably happier! But that always felt like work to me. It made gratitude into a job, and so, even after trying many times, I tended to avoid it. I didn&amp;#x27;t disagree with the ideas, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ava.substack.com/p/its-beautiful-i-just-dont-always&quot;&gt;whenever I stepped back I realized my life was really pretty great&lt;/a&gt;. I just couldn&amp;#x27;t make it a consistent habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one thing I&amp;#x27;ve done recently has changed this. Pretty dramatically in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time being critical. I&amp;#x27;d go so far as to say 999 out of a 1000 thoughts are critical. I am constantly noticing things that are out of place, that could be improved, that are bad, that are dumb. This is hugely useful in a working context, it makes you detail oriented and motivated to improve things. But if you can&amp;#x27;t shut that voice off, it becomes overwhelming and exhausting, coloring your whole experience. If you are almost only noticing the bad things, life seems... pretty bad!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do you change the ratio? How do you get to, let&amp;#x27;s be optimistic, and say, 5% grateful/positive thoughts? 5 thoughts out of 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, I would try and &lt;em&gt;convince&lt;/em&gt; myself that life was good. But it felt fake. I was already convinced that things were shit, so saying things like &amp;quot;life is amazing&amp;quot; felt false. Like I was a bad salesman trying to pitch an unimpressed customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a recent realization has changed this. You just have to go to the extreme, foundational basics. You have to get down to the sensory experience. Breathing is... cool actually?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, you are alive. The fact that you are alive is remarkable, actually. Feel your hands, notice the sensations surrounding them. The air as it touches them, their place in space. You are currently operating a body that is an incredible machine. You are the god of a kingdom of specialized cells, waiting to navigate you around earth. Notice your environment. How cool is it that you are here? It is objectively interesting that you exist in this space, right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can follow this, and legitimately appreciate it, you can re-center yourself in any moment. Any moment you feel overwhelmed or anxious, you can bring it back to the incredible-ness of existence, and build on that. Suddenly, the fact that you are in this stressful meeting with the CEO is really, really cool. It&amp;#x27;s not a scary thing, it&amp;#x27;s a remarkable experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any time I catch myself feeling tense or tight, I realize that I&amp;#x27;m caught up in some dumb thought process that is highly critical. I come back to how cool it is that I&amp;#x27;m here, and then that I&amp;#x27;m having whatever experience I&amp;#x27;m having. And, man, I am super grateful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;m really lucky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best of luck changing the ratio, and Happy Thanksgiving!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Listening to your Inner Voice]]></title><description><![CDATA[Recently I learned about mimetic desire, originated by  Rene Girard , but perhaps popularized in tech by  Peter Thiel  who saw him as his…]]></description><link>https://www.jimmyhooker.com/blog/listening-to-your-inner-voice/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jimmyhooker.com/blog/listening-to-your-inner-voice/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.jimmyhooker.com/static/833cefeaee62c4ef807bd78855de3095/Pal-Szinyei-Merse-Meadow-with-Poppies.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently I learned about mimetic desire, originated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimetic_theory&quot;&gt;Rene Girard&lt;/a&gt;, but perhaps popularized in tech by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/peter-thiel-on-rene-girards-influence-2014-11#:~:text=Girard&amp;#x27;s%20main%20concept%20is%20%22mimetic,scapegoat%20to%20return%20to%20balance.&quot;&gt;Peter Thiel&lt;/a&gt; who saw him as his philosophical mentor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TL;DR of mimetic desire is that almost all of our behavior is based on imitation of others, and that it&amp;#x27;s inescapable. You want that nice car because other people see that nice car as valuable and that the larger culture has built up expectations around this object, not necessarily out of some pure desire on your part to have it. Same with prestigious jobs, schools, excess money, fancy clothes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re in business, as Thiel points out, you could base the customers you go after, and the product decisions you make, on your competitors instead of solving for the deeper problems you might focus on if you made more customer-aware, focused decisions that were divorced from considering your competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have struggled my whole life with mimetic desire. Instead of understanding the things that I myself want to do, I base a lot of decision making on those around me. What is the smart decision, based on what others would think? What &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; I be doing with my time? What would impress people?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key problem with this, and something I&amp;#x27;ve found myself thinking about for many years, is that you end up without any of your own opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s easy to see why we ended up this way. Human&amp;#x27;s are tribal creatures with sophisticated social hierarchies that have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/whos-top-monkey-how-social-status-affects-immune-health/&quot;&gt;dramatic impact on health and survival&lt;/a&gt;. In the past, if you were ostracized from the group, it could mean certain death. So it makes sense that our brains evolved to care a great deal about what others think of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, we live in a modern age! For those of us in America, we have more freedom, wealth, and independence than any civilization in history. One of the more difficult things about our age is the sheer quantity of choices we can make about our future, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bschwartz.domains.swarthmore.edu/Sci.Amer.pdf&quot;&gt;impossibility of choosing the &amp;#x27;right&amp;#x27; one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.
— General George Patton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A difficult truth to accept is that it&amp;#x27;s often better to make a bad decision than no decision. We want to be able to look back at our thinking and have it be thoughtful, defensible, clear, articulate, and well supported. But, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/reversible-irreversible-decisions/&quot;&gt;most decisions are reversible&lt;/a&gt;! It&amp;#x27;s often better to &amp;#x27;find out&amp;#x27; than to spend endless amounts of time hand-wringing, researching, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work in product management, but I&amp;#x27;ve also been on the pure creation side as well. I often think of product management as a debug for bad intuition, helping make sure that what you are building is actually something people want vs something you assume people want. You talk to customers, do the research, and build up a sense of what will actually work that is well supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after a while, you build up tacit knowledge. Knowledge that largely feels like instinct, as it&amp;#x27;s been built into muscle memory. You can&amp;#x27;t entirely explain why you know a decision is right, but you know. It&amp;#x27;s been &lt;a href=&quot;https://commoncog.com/blog/tacit-knowledge-is-a-real-thing/&quot;&gt;born through experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I left a job at a bootstrapped, scrappy startup called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.badgermapping.com&quot;&gt;Badger Maps&lt;/a&gt; to join the professionalized product management world. This threw a lot of my opinions and assumptions into doubt. Did my work at Badger translate? Was the tacit knowledge that I built up over time useful in another context?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to revalidate a lot of my thinking and reassess the way I did things. This made trusting my tacit knowledge difficult, and not trusting your gut can lead to bad decisions, plenty of which I made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Thiel highlights from Gerards work, imitation is inescapable, but it&amp;#x27;s possible to be aware of it and double-check yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After considering everyone else&amp;#x27;s opinions, what do you still want to do? What still feels right? Check in with yourself! Don&amp;#x27;t do the thing you don&amp;#x27;t want to do! Ask yourself: &amp;quot;What do I actually want to do?&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Not Be Cynical]]></title><description><![CDATA[I was watching YouTube and I ran into this remarkable interview: Ruby is incredible.

It&amp;#x27;s clear that she is just a force of nature. She exudes life at the age of 87, and as &amp;#x27;limber as a dishrag&amp;#x27;, she just seems invigorated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve often been accused of being overly critical. I like to think I am, on the overall, a pretty optimistic person. I feel like most problems are solvable and that life is getting better and better. This period of time is, imo, one of the most exciting to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, my critical nature has given me an eye for details and a high bar that I set for myself. On the other, I do worry that my critical nature can often bleed into and tinge experiences that could otherwise be really pleasant and enjoyable. It&amp;#x27;s very much so a double-edged sword.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My wife Sara is much more even keeled. She has a balanced nature, is generally happy, and often brings joy to those who spend time in her company. She balances me, and often makes me realize that I need to chill a little bit. Maybe enjoy the short time we have here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;You only get to be alive for a brief interval.

Please only tell me that you love it, but also report bugs!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About two years ago I started &lt;a href=&quot;https://lambdaschool.com&quot;&gt;Lambda School&lt;/a&gt; part time. While I&amp;#x27;d always been a technical kid, I never was able to dedicate the time to fill in the gaps of my programming knowledge. I could hack things together, but I lacked the ability to create cohesive CRUD apps. Anything beyond simple functions was way too much for me. I barely understood what an array was. Lambda School was the first time I could commit to learning programming without quitting my day job, and I jumped at the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#x27;s a lot more to this story, and I want to write about it in more depth, but the long and short is that, while brutal, it worked, and I now know how to program in a lot more depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A while back I stumbled on an app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://artpip.com/&quot;&gt;ArtPip&lt;/a&gt;. It had this core idea of showing everyone who had the app the same piece of art per day. I loved it. I loved being exposed to art that I would have never otherwise seen, I loved how it lasted for 24 hours, and I loved that it was a shared experience with everyone who had the app. Unfortunately, the engineer building it wasn&amp;#x27;t able to continue, and eventually the app itself switched over to photographs instead of paintings. Photographs are great, but they&amp;#x27;re an entirely different medium. It felt like the core reason that I wanted to have the app installed was gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much I loved this concept really stuck with me. When the app died originally I really wanted to recreate it right then, but it would be another year until I started Lambda School, a year from then when I would create my first version, and another year after that until I could really polish it into something that other people could use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:1158px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very simple app conceptually. One piece of art per day, everyone see&amp;#x27;s the same art. That&amp;#x27;s it. It is purely because I love that core experience that I built it. I want everyone to have this same experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, holy crap, was it difficult. There&amp;#x27;s a huge gap between a proof of concept and something much more polished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted a beautiful website and an extremely easy to use admin area to upload and manage the art itself. I wanted everything to be fast, I wanted it to be easy to deploy, and I wanted it to be cheap as hell to host. I think, somehow, I&amp;#x27;ve been able to finally manage all of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:1200px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think I can honestly say this is the culmination of a life long dream to be able to design, build, and deploy apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, for a first app, I really am glad this is it. It is a pure app: No scheme to get you to buy anything. No agenda. It&amp;#x27;s purely about the experience of art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s hard to convey how much you&amp;#x27;ll love it too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artdiario.com/&quot;&gt;Download it&lt;/a&gt;, and don&amp;#x27;t do anything. Just let your desktop change each day. Have some friends download it. Suddenly you&amp;#x27;re talking about art. It&amp;#x27;s a subtle thing, and it makes me unreasonably happy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Being Curious]]></title><description><![CDATA[Be curious, not judgmental - Walt Whitman The other day I listened to a podcast between Ezra Klein and Judson Brewer talking about anxiety…]]></description><link>https://www.jimmyhooker.com/blog/being-curious/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jimmyhooker.com/blog/being-curious/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.jimmyhooker.com/static/5d1a2c23b53ef981d23b1ae5d1dba5e2/unsplash-daniele-franchi.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be curious, not judgmental - Walt Whitman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other day I listened to a podcast between Ezra Klein and Judson Brewer talking about anxiety. If you have even mild bouts of anxiety, I highly recommend it: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/20/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-judson-brewer.html&quot;&gt;Ezra Klein and Judson Brewer on Anxiety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core takeaway for me was around meditation, and how a key component of that is curiosity. A ton of meditation centers around focusing on your breath, but what does it mean to focus on your breath?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/index&quot;&gt;Vipassana&lt;/a&gt; around 7 years ago. The long and short is that it&amp;#x27;s a 10-day meditation retreat, free of charge, where you meditate silently for approximately 11 hours a day (with breaks for eating/walking/napping in between sessions). It is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; intense, which is what attracted me to it in the first place. While I&amp;#x27;ve gotten a few people to do it, I get why most people are not into the idea. It sounds like work, and really, it is. Most would rather go to the beach, and that&amp;#x27;s valid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for me, someone who has pretty consistently struggled to maintain a sense of inner peace, it sounded like a key to unlocking my self. And, in many ways, it has become an incredible tool in my tool belt. I always feel better after doing it. At the same time, I really fight with it. It has always felt like making myself exercise, or do something against my will. Buster Benson talks a bit about this in his post &lt;a href=&quot;https://busterbenson.com/blog/2014/10-22-better-than-meditation/&quot;&gt;Better than Meditation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, I always feel like I&amp;#x27;m enduring meditation. That the goal is just to get to the end and then I will be free. I will have done the chore. However, doing this, I&amp;#x27;ve noticed that I actually feel this way about a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I just get through this project at Lambda School, I will be done with this pain. If I can just save X amount, I can get this Y. If I can just get through the end of this week, I&amp;#x27;ll be free this weekend. If I just get this job, this apartment, this life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;m not the first person to have this realization. We are all on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill&quot;&gt;hedonic treadmill&lt;/a&gt; to some degree or another. But do I want to spend my whole life just anticipating things? When do I actually get to enjoy things?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently saw a bit of an interview on Twitter with Mads Mikkelson where he mentions his philosophy about life, and it struck me as the most ideal possible way to really live:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;this answer from mads mikkelsen has literally stopped me in my tracks &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/vbUAphPj9c&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/vbUAphPj9c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— lucy ford (@lucyj_ford) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lucyj_ford/status/1384502769076170763?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brings us back to curiosity. In the interview, Judson talks about curiosity as being a way of subverting your natural tendency to anticipate or ruminate. By being curious about the present, you take your attention away from the past and future, which don&amp;#x27;t actually exist. Instead of just trying to get past your current state, you develop an interest in it, even if it feels painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you stop being anxious about the future? Develop an interest in the present. What is happening presently? You are breathing, you are existing in this world, everything about your circumstances is a miracle. Daniel Kaluuya agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div url=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-xZDBohxhE?start=173&quot; title=&quot;Daniel Kaluuya at the Oscars&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#x27;s happening right now. What is your breath like. What are the nuances of it. What does it feel like leaving your nose. What&amp;#x27;s the quality of your breath? How hot is it? How many seconds can you maintain focus on your breath? Can you just observe? Can you witness things? How long can you be curious about the current moment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the current problem you are facing in life? Can you treat it like it&amp;#x27;s a puzzle? A fun game? Or is it something to be endured? Is life just to be struggled against until you die? Or can you see it as an incredible opportunity, something to be curious about, to enjoy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/kilcup.1/262/feynman.html?repostindays=413&quot;&gt;this article by Richard Feynman&lt;/a&gt; the other day around him finding his way back to loving physics.

If you can tighten your feedback loops, you can iterate faster. Both of these things will allow you to move very fast in the right direction. But more than that, James Somers talks about the perceived weight of work being reduced dramatically by working quickly in general: &lt;a href=&quot;http://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters&quot;&gt;Speed Matters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In essence, if something takes a long time, you will avoid it. If it happens quickly, you will do more of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same thing is true of the end-user&amp;#x27;s experience of the software itself. If they can focus and the software feels fast, they will use it more. The pleasure of using it makes you want to use it more. Craig Mod writes about this beautifully here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/&quot;&gt;Fast Software, the Best Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While reading up on feedback loops I ran across Andrew Certain&amp;#x27;s explanation of how communication and consensus can cripple the feedback loops that allow software to be developed faster. In order to increase speed at Amazon, Bezos basically said to ditch the idea of avoiding duplication of effort in order to execute faster (read the whole thread!):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Part of the reason for Amazon&amp;#x27;s incredible success across a staggering array of ventures is our focus on pushing autonomy down as far as possible. Jeff said from the start, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#x27;t want to make communication more efficient - I want there to be less communication!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;— Andrew Certain (@tacertain) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tacertain/status/1166039964582199297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 26, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charSet=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of communication, transparency, and consensus was so high that it wasn&amp;#x27;t worth the effort. It was actually better to get rid of cross-team communication and heavily segment the application in order to ship new products faster. Werner Vogels, Amazon&amp;#x27;s CTO goes into more detail here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2019/08/modern-applications-at-aws.html&quot;&gt;Modern Applications at AWS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an almost heretical idea on its face and goes against a core tenant of software development: Don&amp;#x27;t repeat yourself!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideas of &amp;#x27;fail fast&amp;#x27; and &amp;#x27;move fast and break things&amp;#x27; are now widely satirized. However, I think they&amp;#x27;re still deeply true. Moving fast is exciting, just look at any new burgeoning software framework. People love to get involved in projects that really &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; fast. They&amp;#x27;re rewarding and there&amp;#x27;s the most opportunity to really stand out and feel like your contribution matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything that slows you down should be looked at with skepticism and there should be insanely high value associated with the trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rationalizing design]]></title><description><![CDATA[One of the things that got design a seat at the table was data-driven decision making that could be defended.

I don&amp;#x27;t have any evidence to support this, but I really think that design&amp;#x27;s difficulty in justifying itself to engineering is why products in technology had pretty poor design until the last 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple really changed this around the time of the iPhone. It was as if suddenly everyone awoke from their self-imposed stupor and realized that design is meaningful to people. Further, people could prove it by creating well designed applications for the AppStore and watching them win. While many in engineering wrote off Apple as just being a good marketer to idiots who didn&amp;#x27;t care what was in their pocket (ask anyone over 30 about this), over time the appreciation for polished, thoughtful design and experience became mainstream among many companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#x27;s awesome right? People finally appreciate designers! However, one big problem I have regarding this nice little seat at the table is defensibility. I know, I know, not a popular thing to say nowadays. Let&amp;#x27;s explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asana, Twitter, Google, Pinterest, Yelp, Amazon and many more all have retained their early ancestral structure that have been polished and refined over time. Why? If data was so important to design, shouldn&amp;#x27;t we have realized those early, non-data-driven approaches were wrong? Shouldn&amp;#x27;t the data suggest that we do something entirely different? Did the original designer or team just, &lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt;, have a good intuitive sense about things??&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that really brought this to the forefront of my mind was an article about how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.figma.com/blog/design-on-a-deadline-how-notion-pulled-itself-back-from-the-brink-of-failure/&quot;&gt;Notion saved itself&lt;/a&gt; from death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ivan talks about how he spent upwards of 18 hours a day designing. When you are iterating at that rate, you&amp;#x27;re working off of intuition and judgement, plain and simple. Sure, he spent time talking through his ideas with Simon, but there wasn&amp;#x27;t a written out plan for the design that he then just executed. Instead he made tons of versions, evaluated them using his and Simon&amp;#x27;s judgement and intuition, and chose what &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; like the best choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the taste is there, which you can grow by studying typography and the giants of industry, you can churn out versions until you find the best one.” - Ivan &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know. &lt;em&gt;Feelings&lt;/em&gt;. Damn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We, as designers, sometimes just &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that something is good. It feels good. We design a ton of versions, and through exposing that design to both our and our teammates judgement we file off the rough edges, massage it, and finally get to the point where it feels &amp;#x27;inevitable&amp;#x27;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you defend that? How do you justify or rationalize it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{% include image.html url=&amp;quot;/images/unsplash-artist-description-card.jpg&amp;quot; %}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of those little cards that artists put next to their paintings, explaining their intentions. Why is this necessary? Isn&amp;#x27;t this superfluous? I understand designers are problem solvers, not artists, but can it all be explained? Should it all be explained? Further, if you do explain it, isn&amp;#x27;t it just hindsight analysis? What&amp;#x27;s the point? Isn&amp;#x27;t it just performative?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another metaphor: Comedy. How do you rationalize or justify a joke? Jokes are forged through judgement and experience. Whether or not they were good is decided by the audience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good design, like good art, stands on its own. It needs no defense. It either works or it doesn&amp;#x27;t.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Design for Repetition]]></title><description><![CDATA[After building multiple applications used by thousands of paying customers I feel like I've converged on a philosophy of design that could…]]></description><link>https://www.jimmyhooker.com/blog/design-for-repetition/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jimmyhooker.com/blog/design-for-repetition/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.jimmyhooker.com/static/8ed5002d1f7670327b5735be9cfb142d/unsplash-leonel-fernandez.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After building multiple applications used by thousands of paying customers I feel like I&amp;#x27;ve converged on a philosophy of design that could be summed up as &amp;#x27;Design for Repetition&amp;#x27;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your app used a lot? Or a little? Is your app meant to be engaging? Or are people supposed to get in and out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of design decisions can be solved by understanding not just the way your user wants to interact with your application, but by how often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.badgermapping.com/&quot;&gt;Badger&lt;/a&gt;, our customers interact with the app many times during a workday and perform a few interactions almost constantly. With all this repetition, our goals converged on the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get the hell out of the way&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make it really easy to undo/redo actions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce steps, confirmation, and any explicit actions as much as possible&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#x27;t hide buttons (for example, on hover-state)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With enough repetition you barely had to pay attention to what you were doing within our application. Making mistakes was a non-issue, you could quickly undo/redo whatever action had occurred. Did they upload bad data? No big deal, they can undo that. Did they mess up their route? No worries, they can quickly clear and re-add items through multiple points of entry intuitively and in seconds. Did they click the wrong item during a check-in? Just click again and choose the new option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates strong feedback loops where poeple ultimately feel safe in the app. Instead of something that might betray their trust, it becomes an extension of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about any tool in a woodshop. The tool is designed for constant, repetitive actions, so that you can rely on it, you can trust it. With enough time, you don&amp;#x27;t have to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make software that is designed for repetition. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Crippling, Imaginary Audience]]></title><description><![CDATA[When I was younger I had multiple websites where I posted often.

I didn&amp;#x27;t care what I wrote because I was just writing for my friends. Doing this improved my writing dramatically. It forced me to focus on who my audience was, have a goal in writing (always write to persuade!), and to write for actual consumption. People I knew actually read my site! Having any audience at all was just fun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then I got fired for talking shit about my boss. One of my coworkers who didn&amp;#x27;t like me ratted me out. I was nineteen years old and a complete dumbass. The public nature of the internet was just starting to rear its ugly head and I was one of a number of people who were getting fired for confusing their personal websites for a secluded corner of the internet. This appears to be a difficult lesson to learn, as this still happens constantly to people on Twitter well over a decade later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Sometimes twitter is like that downstairs storage room in a horror movie from which odd sounds emerge. Best to walk right past it. Don’t touch the door. Whatever’s going on in there, let it play out.&lt;/p&gt;— walter kirn (@walterkirn) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/walterkirn/status/1158564227205873664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 6, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public nature of the internet is a hard thing to wrap your head around. Humans weren&amp;#x27;t built to appreciate this kind of scale. People constantly post things that are inflammatory, offensive, disrespectful, off-color, wrong-headed, problematic, bad jokes, and more. To their friends, who appreciate the human at the core of it, these posts are just one aspect of a person who contains multitudes. But this melts away once you get to the first person who hasn&amp;#x27;t met them. Suddenly, you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93observer_asymmetry&quot;&gt;actor-observer bias&lt;/a&gt; running rampant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cast a wide enough net, and you are stripped of your humanity. You become infamous, an overnight celebrity with all the scrutiny that comes with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a terrifying potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, a number of thoughtful articles have been written on what is now a big enough problem to be called &amp;#x27;cancel culture&amp;#x27;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/style/society/2014/06/monica-lewinsky-humiliation-culture&quot;&gt;Monica Lewinsky on the Culture of Humiliation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html&quot;&gt;How One Stupid Tweet Blew Up Justine Sacco’s Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/opinion/call-out-social-justice.html&quot;&gt;The Cruelty of Call-Out Culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/style/is-it-canceled.html&quot;&gt;Everyone Is Canceled&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.firstthings.com/article/2019/01/shame-storm&quot;&gt;Shame Storm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mob wants justice and it wants public executions. You&amp;#x27;re a seventeen year-old kid? Too bad, you are a monster now. The President and you had a tryst? Sorry, you&amp;#x27;re a slut and the butt of jokes for life. The human desire for blood-lust hasn&amp;#x27;t abated, it has just changed form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Each day on twitter there is one main character. The goal is to never be it.&amp;quot; this is .. deeply true. Originally tweeted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/maplecocaine?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@maplecocaine&lt;/a&gt; who, er, apparently deleted their account..?&lt;/p&gt;— Jeff Atwood (@codinghorror) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/1115087311195127808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 8, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why post at all? Why voice any opinions in such a dangerous environment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still have a lot of difficulty with this. For now at least, the lesson might be that you shouldn&amp;#x27;t touch anything that is controversial unless you have some very well defined thoughts on the subject. If you haven&amp;#x27;t done your research and you haven&amp;#x27;t debated someone knowledgeable, leave it alone. As soon as you put words to paper, you are inviting people to pick it apart. This is not you and your friends around a beer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this isn&amp;#x27;t a bad lesson. We are not all journalists and comedians. We are not prepared for the responsibility and weight of our words. For many of us, perhaps only managers, teachers, and our parents have read our writing. And now you want the whole internet to respond? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you really want to enter the arena, maybe best to leave it to someone else. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
